# three.js-Terrain-Heightmap
*A basic rendering script for visualising a heightmap.*
## Sources:
* ***Heightmap*** from https://terrain.party/ which is a source for heightmaps usually used in cities skylines maps
* ***Three.js libraries*** from https://three.js/
* ***Pointerlock controls*** based from a tutorial documenting the pointerlock control module included with ***three.js***

## Plans to extend this in the future:
* Ability to render triangle-strips rather than just blocks
* More optimisation so heightmaps can be used at a proper resoloution
* Scaling of player controls to make it more realistic
* Cleaning up of code for easier use
* The creation of a deformable mesh after terrain is loaded, which can be depressed/deformed by player footsteps
